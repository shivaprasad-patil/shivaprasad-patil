### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I am Shivaprasad Patil.
I am a computational biologist with expertise in Genomics and Machine learning. I use Python and R for analysing genomic and clinical data to identify people most at risk of disease.

â€¢	 ðŸ’» Currently working on machine learning methods to  identify biomarkers for individualised cancer te=reatments from transcriptomic data and clinical data. 
â€¢	 ðŸ‘¨ Currently growing my skillset in Machine Learning and Genomic Data Science.

My Reseach Interests:
â€¢	 Translating genomics to personalised medicine.
â€¢	 Using machine learning to identify new therapeutic approaches and drug discovery.
â€¢  Using next-generation sequencing datasets to udnerstand disease progression and predict prognosis.


I am open to:
â€¢	 any collobration work,
â€¢	 machine learning projects related to disease genomics
